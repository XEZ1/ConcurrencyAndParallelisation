## Introduction

The main objective of this project was o harness the power of parallel computing to accelerate the execution of computationally intensive tasks. I explored the use of threads to perform parallel computation, leveraging the capabilities of modern hardware to enhance performance. I also utilised semaphores to facilitate controlled access in concurrent scenarios, demonstrating the advantages of utilising synchronisation techniques to manage shared resources effectively.

## Part 1 - Parallel Mean Computation

In this part, **Parallel Mean Computation** project, we explore the efficiency of parallelising a task using threads to calculate the mean value of a list of numbers.

## Part 2 - Concurrent Matrix Multiplication

In this repository, the **Concurrent Matrix Multiplication** project, we delve into parallel computing techniques to efficiently perform matrix multiplication.

## Part 3 - Concurrent Access Control and Semaphore Usage

Here, in the **Concurrent Access Control and Semaphore Usage** project, we explore the efficient control of concurrent access using semaphores. In this project, I demonstrate practical implementation of synchronisation mechanisms and explore the producer-consumer pattern to manage shared resources.
